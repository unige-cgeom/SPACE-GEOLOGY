    "text": "What You Will Do\nYou will estimate sediment flux at river outlets through deep time using paleogeography, hydrology, and climate data from the Palaeo Data Cube. Starting with one time slice, you will: 1. Identify major river outlets near ancient coastlines. 2. Compute basin attributes (area, relief, temperature). 3. Apply the BQART equation to estimate sediment flux.\nThen, you will scale up your workflow to compare two time slices and finally analyze trends across the entire Phanerozoic."
