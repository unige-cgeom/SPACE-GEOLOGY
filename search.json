Starting with paleogeographic reconstructions, students analyze how land–ocean distribution changed from 100 Ma to the entire Phanerozoic by loading GeoTIFF rasters, computing global statistics, and visualizing maps and time series in Python. The course then expands to test geodynamic hypotheses by integrating seafloor age, crustal thickness, and lithospheric thickness datasets to examine how spreading rates and crustal architecture evolved through time. Finally, students model sediment delivery to ancient coastlines by combining paleogeography, hydrology, and climate data to identify river outlets, compute basin properties, and estimate sediment flux using the BQART framework. Across all exercises, students develop core GIS and coding skills, learn to automate multi-dataset workflows, and interpret how tectonics, climate, and surface processes interact to shape Earth systems over hundreds of millions of years.\n\n\nExercise 2: Landslide risk assessement in an Alpine context\nThe second exercise focuses on a regional-scale application in the Swiss Alps, where students assess landslide susceptibility using GIS-based spatial analysis. By integrating high-resolution digital elevation models with geological maps and other relevant spatial layers, students evaluate how topography and geological conditions control slope instability. The exercise emphasizes practical risk assessment methods, including terrain analysis and multi-layer overlay, to identify areas most prone to landslides in an Alpine environment."
