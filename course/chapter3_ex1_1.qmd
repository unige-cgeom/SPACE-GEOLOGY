## Reconstructing Earth’s Past – From a Snapshot to Deep Time


### Big Question
*How did Earth look 100 million years ago, and how has its geography changed over hundreds of millions of years?*

### What You Will Do

In this module, you will:

1.	Start simple: Explore a single paleogeographic map and visualize Earth at 100 Ma.

2.	Compare worlds: Compute and interpret differences in land and ocean distribution between two time slices.

3.	Go deep time: Extend your analysis to the entire Phanerozoic (last 540 million years) and identify major trends.

### Why This Matters

Earth’s geography controls climate, ocean circulation, and biodiversity. By reconstructing these changes, you’ll learn how scientists use data and coding to answer fundamental questions about our planet’s history.

### Your Tasks

1. **Find the data:** Locate paleogeographic GeoTIFF files in the Palaeo Data Cube repository.
2. **Load and inspect:** Read raster data in Python, check metadata, and understand its structure.
3. **Compute basic stats:**

    3.1. Land vs. ocean fraction for a chosen time slice.

    3.2. Differences between two slices.

    3.3. A time series of land fraction across the Phanerozoic.

4. **Visualize:** 

   4.1 Global maps using matplotlib and cartopy.

    4.2. A trend plot showing how land/ocean distribution evolved.

### Skills You Will Gain

1. Working with GeoTIFFs in Python (rasterio, numpy).
2. Performing basic geospatial analysis (masking, counting, area-aware calculations).
3. Creating global maps and time-series plots.
4. Automating workflows for multi-step analysis.


### Points for Discussion

*What assumptions did you make when defining land vs. ocean?*

*How does using pixel counts vs. area-aware calculations affect your results?*

*What patterns do you see in land fraction across the Phanerozoic? Any surprises?*
