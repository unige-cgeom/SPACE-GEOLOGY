## How Fast Was Earth’s Engine Running?

## Big Question

*Did faster spreading rates in the past lead to younger seafloor and thinner lithosphere? How did crustal architecture evolve through time?*

## What You Will Do
You will test a geodynamic hypothesis using multiple paleogeographic and structural datasets from the Palaeo Data Cube. Starting with one time slice, you will:

1. Map seafloor age, crustal thickness, and lithospheric thickness.
2. Compute global averages and distributions.
3. Compare two time slices to see if patterns change.
4. Finally, you will extend your analysis to the entire Phanerozoic and visualize trends.

## Why It Matters

The age and thickness of Earth’s oceanic crust and lithosphere reflect plate tectonic processes and mantle dynamics. Understanding these changes helps explain supercontinent cycles, ocean basin evolution, and even long-term climate regulation.

## Your Tasks

1. **Single Snapshot Analysis:** 

    1.1. Load seafloor age, crustal thickness, and lithospheric thickness for one time slice (e.g., 100 Ma).

    1.2. Compute mean values and visualize maps.

    1.3. Plot histograms of seafloor age distribution.

2. **Compare Two Worlds:**
    
    2.1. Repeat for another time slice (e.g., 250 Ma).
    
    2.2. Compare averages and distributions.

    2.3. Discuss whether the data supports faster spreading at one time.

3. **Deep-Time Trends:**

    3.1. Automate your workflow for all Phanerozoic slices.
    
    3.2. Plot time series of mean seafloor age, crustal thickness, and lithospheric thickness.
    
    3.3. Interpret major trends and link them to tectonic events.


## Skills You Will Gain

1. Handling multiple raster datasets in Python.
2. Computing global and zonal statistics.
3. Visualizing maps, histograms, and time-series plots.
4. Testing hypotheses with real geoscience data.

## Points for Discussion

*Does the data support the idea that faster spreading rates lead to younger seafloor?*

*How do crustal and lithospheric thickness trends relate to supercontinent cycles?*

*What assumptions did you make about data interpretation and resolution?*

*What uncertainties exist in these reconstructions?*
