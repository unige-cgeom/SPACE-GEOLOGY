## Sediment Flux Modelling

## Big Question

*How did sediment delivery to ancient coastlines vary across the Phanerozoic, and what controls these changes?*

## What You Will Do

You will estimate sediment flux at river outlets through deep time using paleogeography, hydrology, and climate data from the Palaeo Data Cube. Starting with one time slice, you will:
1. Identify major river outlets near ancient coastlines.
2. Compute basin attributes (area, relief, temperature).
3. Apply the BQART equation to estimate sediment flux. 

Then, you will scale up your workflow to compare two time slices and finally analyze trends across the entire Phanerozoic.


## Why This Matters

Sediment flux is a key link between tectonics, climate, and the carbon cycle. Understanding how sediment delivery changed through time helps explain ocean chemistry, nutrient cycles, and even long-term climate regulation.

## Your Tasks

1.	**Single Snapshot Analysis:**

    1.1. Load paleogeography, flow direction, flow accumulation, and temperature for one time slice (e.g., 100 Ma).

    1.2. Identify outlets near coastlines using flow accumulation and land/ocean mask.

    1.3. Compute basin attributes: drainage area, relief, mean temperature.

    1.4. Apply BQART to estimate sediment flux at each outlet.
    
    1.5. Visualize sediment flux on a global map.

2.	Compare Two Worlds

    2.1. Repeat for another time slice (e.g., 250 Ma).
    
    2.2. Compare sediment flux patterns and discuss differences.
3.	Deep-Time Trends
    
    3.1. Automate your workflow for all Phanerozoic slices.
    
    3.2. Plot time series of global sediment flux and interpret major trends.


## Skills You Will Gain

1. Advanced raster analysis and hydrological modeling in Python.
2. Basin delineation and outlet detection using flow direction and accumulation.
3. Applying empirical models (BQART) to paleodata.
4. Visualizing spatial patterns and temporal trends.


## Points for Discussion

*Which factors (area, relief, temperature) most strongly influence sediment flux?*

*How does paleogeography control sediment routing?*

*What assumptions did you make about outlet selection and basin delineation?*

*How do tectonic and climate changes explain sediment flux trends?*
